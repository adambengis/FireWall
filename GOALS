GOALS OF THIS PROJECT:

  * This project has two major goals. 
  ** The first is to provide an opportunity to learn C++ programming beyond just the syntax. 
  ** The second is to create a working piece of freeware that acts as a guest tracking system
     for students with guests that can run on a machine as small as a raspberry pi and can
     interface with existing student identification technologies.
     
  * Each of these goals on their own are no easy task, and it will be a great challenge to 
    design a system using top-down planning and to revise it as new skills are developed.
    
  * An end goal of this software is to attempt to implement it at Drexel University in Philadelphia
    as a beta trial. Doing so would improve students' residence hall experience, generate 
    good press for Drexel, and create a new publicly available piece of freeware.
